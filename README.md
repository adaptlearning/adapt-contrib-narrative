**Narrative** is a *presentation component* bundled with the [Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework).

**Narrative** displays items (or slides) that present an image and text side-by-side. Left and right navigation controls allow the learner to progress horizontally through the items. Optional text may precede it. Useful for detailing a sequential process. On mobile devices, the narrative text is collapsed above the image.

[Visit the **Narrative** wiki](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-narrative/wiki) for more information about its functionality and for explanations of key properties.

## Installation

As one of Adapt's *[core components](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-Plug-ins-in-the-Adapt-Learning-Framework#components),* **Narrative** is included with the [installation of the Adapt framework](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Manual-installation-of-the-Adapt-framework#installation) and the [installation of the Adapt authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Installing-Adapt-Origin).

* If **Narrative** has been uninstalled from the Adapt framework, it may be reinstalled.
With the [Adapt CLI](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-cli) installed, run the following from the command line:  
`adapt install adapt-contrib-narrative`

    Alternatively, this component can also be installed by adding the following line of code to the *adapt.json* file:  
    `"adapt-contrib-narrative": "*"`  
    Then running the command:  
    `adapt install`  
    (This second method will reinstall all plug-ins listed in *adapt.json*.)  

* If **Narrative** has been uninstalled from the Adapt authoring tool, it may be reinstalled using the [Plug-in Manager](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki/Plugin-Manager).

## Settings Overview

The attributes listed below are used in *components.json* to configure **Narrative**, and are properly formatted as JSON in [*example.json*](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-narrative/blob/master/example.json). Visit the [**Narrative** wiki](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-narrative/wiki) for more information about how they appear in the [authoring tool](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_authoring/wiki).

### Attributes

[**core model attributes**](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes): These are inherited by every Adapt component. [Read more](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Core-model-attributes).

**_component** (string): This value must be: `narrative`.

**_classes** (string): CSS class name to be applied to **Narrative**’s containing div. The class must be predefined in one of the Less files. Separate multiple classes with a space.

**_layout** (string): This defines the horizontal position of the component in the block. Acceptable values are `full`, `left` or `right`; however, `full` is typically the only option used as `left` or `right` do not allow much room for the component to display.

**instruction** (string): This optional text appears above the component. It is frequently used to guide the learner’s interaction with the component.   

**mobileInstruction** (string): This is optional instruction text that will be shown when viewed on mobile. It may be used to guide the learner’s interaction with the component.   

**_hasNavigationInTextArea** (boolean): Determines the location of the arrows (icons) used to navigate from slide to slide. Navigation can overlay the image or the text. Set to `true` to have the navigation controls appear in the text region.

**_setCompletionOn** (string): This value determines when the component registers as complete. Acceptable values are `"allItems"` and `"inview"`. `"allItems"` requires the learner to navigate to each slide. `"inview"` requires the **Narrative** component to enter the view port completely, top and bottom.

**_items** (array): Multiple items may be created. Each item represents one slide and contains values for the narrative (**title**, **body**), the image (**_graphic**), and the slide's header when viewed on a mobile device (**_strapLine**).

>**title** (string): This value is the title for this narrative element.

>**body** (string): This is the main text for this narrative element.

>**_graphic** (object): The image that appears next to the narrative text. It contains values for **src** and **alt**.

>>**src** (string): File name (including path) of the image. Path should be relative to the *src* folder (e.g.,*course/en/images/origami-menu-two.jpg*).

>>**alt** (string): This text becomes the image’s `alt` attribute.

>>**attribution** (string): Optional text to be displayed as an [attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Best_practices_for_attribution). By default it is displayed below the image. Adjust positioning by modifying CSS. Text can contain HTML tags, e.g., `Copyright © 2015 by <b>Lukasz 'Severiaan' Grela</b>`.

>**strapline** (string): This text is displayed as a title above the image when `Adapt.device.screenSize` is `small` (i.e., when viewed on mobile devices).  

### Accessibility  
**Narrative** has been assigned a label using the [aria-label](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt_framework/wiki/Aria-Labels) attribute: **ariaRegion**. This label is not a visible element. It is utilized by assistive technology such as screen readers. Should the region's text need to be customised, it can be found within the **globals** object in [*properties.schema*](https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-narrative/blob/master/properties.schema).
